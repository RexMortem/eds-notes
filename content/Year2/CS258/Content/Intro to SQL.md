## Declarative over Procedural
The DB System philosophy: *"Tell the DBS what you want"*.

**Data Manipulation Languages (DMLs)** are for querying/updating data and should be **declarative**; say what you want, but not how to do it. 
Why? **Query Optimisation:** the DBS will find an optimal (or close to) way to execute query. 

**Data Definition Languages (DDLs)** are for defining the DB.
