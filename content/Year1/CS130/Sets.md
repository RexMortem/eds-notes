A set is a mathematical object with a notion of membership i.e. whether something is in it or not. 

Since they do NOT have a notion of counting, you can only include an element *once*.
That is, $\{A, B, C\} = \{A, A, B, C\} = \{A, B, B, C, C\}$.
(sets are typically wrapped in curly braces $\{\}$)
 
We can interact with a set $S$ by asking whether an element $a$ is in the set (with $a \in S$), and asking how many (unique) elements are in the set ($|S|$).
- For example, let $A = \{1, banana, ‚≠ê\}$
- $1 \in A$? True.
- $2 \in A$? False. 
- $|A| = 3$.
- $|\{1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4\}| = 4$.

There are also useful operations between sets


Some common (and useful) examples of (non-finite) sets:
- the natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$
- the integers $\mathbb{Z}$
